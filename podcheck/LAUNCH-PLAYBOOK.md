# PodCheck Launch Playbook
### "Every claim. Checked."

---

## 1. Pre-Launch (T-14 to T-1)

### Teaser Campaign

**Week 1 (T-14 to T-7): Mystery Phase**

- **Twitter/X:** Post anonymous claim verdicts without naming the product. Examples:
  - "A top health podcaster claimed cold plunges boost dopamine 250%. The actual study says 200-300% for norepinephrine, not dopamine. Grade: C-" 
  - "A finance podcaster said 'inflation has never exceeded 15% in US history.' It hit 23.7% in 1920. Grade: F"
  - End each with: "Something's coming. 👀"
- **Reddit:** Drop these as standalone posts in r/podcasts ("Anyone else notice how often podcast hosts get facts wrong?") — seed the problem awareness.

**Week 2 (T-7 to T-1): Reveal Phase**

- Reveal the brand. Change Twitter bio. Post the landing page.
- Tweet: "We fact-checked 500+ claims across 7 of the biggest podcasts. Graded every host A through F. Launching [date]. Get early access → [link]"
- Post a blurred leaderboard screenshot — visible enough to see letter grades but not names. "Who got the F? Find out [date]."

### Landing Page

**Headline:** Every claim. Checked.  
**Subhead:** AI-powered accuracy grades for the world's biggest podcasts. See who's telling the truth — and who's winging it.  
**Body:**
- "We analyze every factual claim made on top podcasts. Each one is verified against primary sources, peer-reviewed research, and public data."
- "Hosts and guests receive letter grades (A-F) based on accuracy, source quality, and correction rate."
- "No ads. No partisan agenda. Just facts."
- Show 3 sample verdict cards (blurred names)
- Email capture: "Get your access code on launch day"
- Counter: "[X] people waiting"

>
> Then we graded every host and guest A through F.
>
> Some people aced it. Some people... didn't.
>
> Introducing PodCheck → [link]

> 2/ Here's how it works:
>
> AI extracts every factual claim from an episode → each claim is verified against primary sources, peer-reviewed research, and public data → hosts/guests get a letter grade.

> 🏥 The Drive (Peter Attia)
> 📈 Acquired
> 📊 Freakonomics
> 🧬 Found My Fitness

> More coming soon.

> 4/ First finding: the most "scientific-sounding" podcast isn't always the most accurate.
>
> Citing a study ≠ citing it correctly.

> 5/ We built a category system:

> Self-correction rate is part of the grade. Intellectual honesty matters.

> 9/ "But AI makes mistakes too!"
>
> Yes. Every verdict links to its sources. Every grade shows its work. You can dispute any verdict.
>
> We're not the final word. We're the starting point for verification.

> 10/ No ads. No paywall for basic grades. No partisan agenda.

### Product Hunt Launch

**Name:** PodCheck  
**Tagline:** AI fact-checker that grades podcasts A-F on accuracy  
**Description:**
> PodCheck analyzes every factual claim made on top podcasts and grades hosts/guests on accuracy (A-F). Currently covering All-In, Huberman Lab, Lex Fridman, Peter Attia, Acquired, Freakonomics, and Found My Fitness. No ads, no agenda — just verified facts with linked sources.

**Maker Comment:**
> Hey PH! I'm [name], and I built PodCheck because I realized I was absorbing "facts" from podcasts without ever checking if they were true. Turns out, some of my favorite hosts are great communicators but... not always great with facts. PodCheck extracts every verifiable claim, checks it against primary sources, and gives transparent letter grades. Every verdict shows its work. I'd love your feedback on the methodology — this is a hard problem and I want to get it right. 🙏

### Waitlist Email

**Subject:** PodCheck is live. Here's your access.

> You signed up to know when PodCheck launched. That's today.
>
> → [CTA: See the grades]
>
> We've fact-checked 3,000+ claims across 7 major podcasts and graded every host.
>
> One quick ask: if you find a verdict interesting (or wrong!), share it. Every verdict page has a share button. This is how we grow — and how we get better.
>
> Thanks for believing in this before it existed.

## 3. Week 1 Content Calendar

| Day | Twitter | Reddit | Email |
|-----|---------|--------|-------|
| Mon (Launch) | Launch thread + data highlights | All launch posts | Waitlist "we're live" |
| Tue | "Claim of the day" — most viral wrong claim | Reply to all comments, engage | — |
| Wed | Head-to-head: All-In hosts compared | r/dataisbeautiful visualization | — |
| Thu | "The health claim 3 podcasts got wrong" | r/HubermanLab specific findings | "The Weekly Check #1" |
| Fri | Guest grades spotlight — who aced it, who bombed | r/podcasts "what we learned" reflection | — |
| Sat | Fun stat: "The most confident wrong claim" | — | — |
| Sun | "You asked, we're adding: [new podcast]" poll | — | — |

### Maximum Virality Content

**Best individual claims to highlight:**
- A health/supplement claim from Huberman that's nuanced or contested — the Huberman subreddit is VERY active and already debates his claims
- Chamath or Sacks making a confident economic prediction that data contradicts — the All-In subreddit will go wild
- A guest on Lex getting a surprisingly low grade despite being a credentialed expert

**The Controversial Reveal:**

The All-In hosts, graded individually, will generate the most buzz. The four hosts have massive, opinionated followings who already argue about who's smartest. Revealing their individual grades — especially if there's a clear winner and loser — guarantees engagement. Chamath and Sacks fans will fight. Jason will tweet about it. Friedberg will probably appreciate the methodology.

**Runner-up:** Huberman's grade on supplement claims specifically. His subreddit (r/HubermanLab, 700K+) already has a skeptic contingent. A nuanced grade (good on neuroscience, weaker on supplement specifics) would get massive engagement.

## 4. Podcast Outreach

### Getting Covered by Podcasts

The meta-narrative is your best pitch: "We fact-check podcasts, and now we're ON a podcast." 

**Target shows:**
- My First Million (Shaan + Sam love viral products)
- Lenny's Podcast (product angle)
- The Vergecast (media/tech)
- Hard Fork (NYT — Kevin Roose + Casey Newton)
- Decoder (Nilay Patel)
- Pivot (Kara Swisher + Scott Galloway)
- Darknet Diaries (trust/verification angle)

### Pitch Template

> Subject: We graded [YOUR SHOW] on factual accuracy — want to see your score?
>
> Hi [name],
>
> I built PodCheck — an AI that fact-checks podcasts and grades hosts on accuracy (A-F). We've analyzed [X] episodes of [their show] and I thought you'd want to see your results before they go public.
>
> A few other hosts have already looked at theirs. Some were pleasantly surprised. Some... had notes.
>
> Happy to walk through the methodology — it's a genuinely interesting technical and epistemological challenge. Would also make a great segment if you're interested.
>
> [link to their private results page]

### When a Podcaster Reacts

**Positive reaction (they scored well):** Immediately reply publicly: "Appreciate you sharing! Your episode on [topic] had a 94% accuracy rate — one of the highest we've seen." Give them a shareable badge/graphic: "PodCheck Verified: A Grade."

**Negative reaction (they're upset):** Stay measured and transparent. "We hear you — every verdict links to its sources and methodology. We'd love to have you review specific verdicts you disagree with. Our dispute process is [link]. Getting this right matters more to us than being right."

**They dispute a verdict:** This is GOLD. Publicly engage, show your work, and update if they're right. "You were right — we've updated this verdict. This is exactly how the system improves." This builds more trust than being perfect.

## 6. Ongoing Growth Engine

### Weekly Content Rituals

| Day | Content |
|-----|---------|
| **Monday** | "Weekly Power Rankings" — top-graded episodes from last week |
| **Wednesday** | "Claim of the Week" — most interesting verdict, visualized |
| **Friday** | "Friday Fails" — worst claims of the week (anonymized at first, named if pattern) |

### Automated Twitter/X Strategy

Build a bot (@PodCheckBot or post from main account) that auto-posts:
- New episode grades as they're processed: "New episode graded: [Podcast] E[XX] — [Guest] scored [grade]. [X] claims checked. See verdicts → [link]"
- "This week's most repeated wrong claim across podcasts: [claim]"
- Daily "Did you know?" — a surprising verdict

### Newsletter: "The Weekly Check"

**Format:**
1. **The Leaderboard** — this week's best and worst grades
2. **Claim Spotlight** — deep dive on one interesting verdict
3. **The Correction** — any verdicts we updated (builds trust)
4. **New Podcasts Added** — what's coming
5. **Community Pick** — most disputed verdict of the week

Send weekly, Thursday 8 AM PT.

### SEO Strategy

**High-value pages to build:**
- `/podcast/[name]` — overall grade page for each podcast (ranks for "[podcast name] accuracy")
- `/podcast/[name]/[episode]` — episode-level grades (ranks for episode titles)
- `/person/[name]` — individual accuracy profile (ranks for "[person name] fact check")
- `/claim/[topic]` — claim category pages ("cold plunge benefits fact check")
- `/verdict/[specific-claim]` — individual verdicts (long-tail)

**Target keywords:**
- "[podcast name] fact check" (all 7 podcasts)
- "is [claim] true" (for popular claims)
- "podcast accuracy" / "podcast misinformation"
- "[guest name] claims" / "[guest name] accuracy"
- "huberman lab supplements evidence" (high search volume)

**Content plays:** Blog posts analyzing trends: "Which Podcast Category Has the Most Misinformation?" — linkable, shareable, SEO-rich.

### Community

**Start with r/PodCheck subreddit** — lower friction than Discord. Post every verdict, let people debate. Moderate lightly.

**Discord later** (1,000+ active users) — channels per podcast, #dispute-a-verdict, #suggest-a-podcast.

---

## 7. Guerrilla Tactics

### Manufacturing the First Viral Moment

**The Leaderboard Drop:** On launch day +2, post a clean, shareable graphic ranking all 7 podcasts by accuracy grade. Simple A-F leaderboard. This WILL get screenshotted and shared because people love rankings and will argue about them. Post to Twitter, Reddit, and email it to every seed list contact.

**The Head-to-Head:** "We fact-checked the same topic across 4 podcasts. Here's who got it right." Pick a topic that multiple shows covered (AI risk, GLP-1 drugs, inflation) and show how different hosts handled the same facts. Visualization-friendly, debate-inducing.

### Podcast Community Infiltration

**Subreddits to engage (as a participant, not spammer):**
- r/HubermanLab (780K) — already skeptical, will love verification
- r/lexfridman (300K) — values truth-seeking
- r/allin (50K) — loves host drama
- r/Biohackers (500K) — health claims
- r/podcasts (2.5M) — general
- r/ChatGPT, r/artificial (AI angle)

**Facebook Groups:** "Huberman Lab Podcast Discussion" (100K+), "Podcast Recommendations" groups

**Strategy:** Don't just drop links. Engage in existing debates about claims and casually mention "actually, we checked this — here's what we found." Become the source people cite.

### Creative Plays

1. **"Grade My Podcast" challenge** — Let any podcaster submit their RSS feed for grading. Creates inbound demand and FOMO.

2. **Shareable verdict cards** — Instagram/Twitter-optimized cards for individual claims. "CLAIM: [X]. VERDICT: [Y]. GRADE: [Z]." Designed to be screenshotted.

3. **Chrome extension** — Shows PodCheck grades on Spotify/Apple Podcasts/YouTube pages. Small effort, huge visibility.

4. **"Before You Listen" widget** — Embeddable accuracy score that podcast review sites can add.

5. **Bet on the reaction:** Email Chamath, Sacks, Jason, and Friedberg their individual grades simultaneously. At least one will tweet about it within 24 hours. Probably Jason. This alone could drive launch day.

### Partnership Opportunities

- **Snopes / PolitiFact** — methodology credibility partnership
- **Podcast hosting platforms** (Spotify for Podcasters, Riverside) — embed grades
- **Newsletter platforms** (Substack, Beehiiv) — co-marketing to newsletter creators who also podcast
- **Podcast clip tools** (Opus Clip, Podium) — show accuracy grades on clips
- **Wikipedia / Wikidata** — use as source, contribute back corrections

## The One Rule

Every piece of content, every interaction, every verdict must reinforce one thing: **PodCheck is accurate, transparent, and has no agenda.** The moment people think you're biased, partisan, or sloppy, trust evaporates and you're just another hot take machine. Show your work. Admit mistakes. Update verdicts publicly. Trust is the product.
