# PodCheck — Viral Mechanics & The Credibility Score Economy

## The Core Insight: Vanity Metrics for Truth

Credit scores work because they're **simple, universal, and consequential**. PodCheck grades work the same way:

- Simple: A through F. Everyone understands it instantly.
- Universal: Every public figure who speaks on podcasts gets one.
- Consequential: Booking agents check it. Audiences check it. Competitors weaponize it.

The magic: **you don't need to market this. The subjects market it for you.**

## The Viral Flywheel

### Stage 1: The Brag Loop
A podcaster gets a B+ or higher. What do they do?

- Tweet it: "Just got my PodCheck score — B+ accuracy across 340 verified claims 🎯"
- Put it in their bio: "PodCheck Verified: A-"
- Add the badge to their website
- Mention it when booking guests: "I only book guests with B or higher"

**This is free, organic marketing from your highest-value users.** Every brag is an ad.

### Stage 2: The Roast Loop
Someone gets a D. Their rivals/critics:

- Quote-tweet: "lol @whoever got a D on PodCheck, maybe stop making stuff up"
- Podcast hosts reference it: "Our next guest has a C- on PodCheck, so let's fact-check in real time"
- Reddit threads: "Look at this guy's claim history 💀"
- Meme potential: screenshots of the worst claims with FALSE stamps

**Controversy is engagement.** Every roast drives traffic.

### Stage 3: The Arms Race
Once scores exist and people care about them:

- Podcasters start **self-correcting on air**: "Actually, let me look that up — I don't want to tank my PodCheck score"
- Guests **prepare more carefully** knowing claims will be tracked
- Hosts use it as a **booking filter** — "minimum B rating to come on my show"
- PR teams **actively manage** their client's scores (dispute bad verdicts, highlight good ones)

**The product changes the behavior it measures.** That's when you've won.

## Specific Viral Features

### 1. The Shareable Report Card
After each episode is processed, generate a **visual report card** — designed for social sharing:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  🎙 PodCheck Episode Report     │
│                                 │
│  All-In Podcast · E178          │
│  Feb 2, 2026                    │
│                                 │
│  Chamath    B-  (7 claims)      │

│                                 │

└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Designed as an **image card** (OG meta tags + downloadable PNG). One click share to Twitter, LinkedIn, group chats.

### 2. The Weekly Power Rankings
Every Monday, publish:

- **Biggest Movers** — who went up/down the most
- **Claim of the Week** — most viral/disputed claim
- **Most Accurate Guest** — weekly award
- **Worst Miss** — the most egregiously wrong claim

This becomes a **ritual**. People check every Monday. Podcasters dread/anticipate it.

### 3. Head-to-Head Comparison Pages
`podcheck.io/compare?a=huberman&b=attia`

Side-by-side accuracy comparison. Designed to settle arguments:
- "Huberman vs Attia — who's more accurate on health claims?"
- "Shapiro vs Pod Save America — who gets the facts right?"

These pages are **built for arguments** — and arguments drive shares.

### 4. The Accuracy Badge (Embeddable)
Like a Yelp sticker for your podcast:

```html
<!-- Embed on your site -->
<a href="podcheck.io/person/huberman">
  <img src="podcheck.io/badge/huberman.svg" />
</a>
```

Shows: Name + Grade + Claim Count. Updates dynamically.

Podcasters with good scores embed these EVERYWHERE. It becomes a trust signal like "BBB Accredited" but for truth.

### 5. The "Correction Credit"
When someone gets a claim wrong and later corrects it on-air:
- They get a **Correction Credit** — partial score recovery
- This incentivizes public corrections
- And it's shareable: "Props to @huberman for correcting his claim on X — PodCheck updated his score"

**Making corrections rewarding instead of punishing = better incentives for everyone.**

### 6. Prediction Tracking (The Long Game)
Predictions don't affect current scores but get tracked publicly:

- "Chamath predicted BTC at $200K by 2026" — PENDING ⏳
- When resolved: "Chamath's BTC prediction: WRONG ❌ (was $67K)"

**Prediction markets are inherently viral.** People LOVE tracking who called it.

Annual "Prediction Report Card" — who was right, who was wildly off.

## The Podcaster's Dilemma (Game Theory)

This is where it gets interesting. Once PodCheck has traction:

**If you're accurate (A/B grade):**
- You promote your score loudly
- You reference it on air
- You link it everywhere
- You become a PodCheck evangelist (free marketing)

**If you're inaccurate (D/F grade):**
- You can't ignore it — your competitors will reference it
- Attacking PodCheck makes you look defensive ("why are you mad about fact-checking?")
- Your best move is to **improve** — check your facts, issue corrections
- Or engage with the dispute system (which drives more traffic to PodCheck)

**There is no winning move against PodCheck except being more accurate.** That's the beauty.

### The Streisand Effect Trap
If a podcaster with a bad score attacks PodCheck publicly:
- It drives traffic to PodCheck
- People look up the score
- They see the evidence
- Net effect: more users, more awareness

The only people who would want to shut PodCheck down are people with bad scores. And their opposition validates the product.

## Influencer Dynamics

### The "PodCheck Certified" Tier
At A- or above with 100+ claims checked:
- Special badge: "PodCheck Certified Accurate ✓"
- Exclusive verification that can't be bought
- This becomes a status symbol

### Podcast Network Effects
When one host on a network gets scored:
- Other hosts on the network want scores too (competitive)
- The network itself gets an aggregate score
- Networks with high scores advertise it: "The most accurate podcast network, verified by PodCheck"

### Guest Booking Integration
The killer app for podcasters:
- Before booking a guest, check their PodCheck score
- "I saw you have a C+ on PodCheck — are you prepared to back up your claims?"
- Guests with high scores become more bookable
- **PodCheck becomes part of the podcast industry's infrastructure**

### Recurring Content

|-----|---------|-------------------|
| Monday | Weekly Power Rankings | Routine engagement, anticipation |
| Wednesday | "Claim of the Week" deep dive | Educational, shareable |

## Social Proof Snowball

```
Month 1:  PodCheck launches → early adopters check scores
Month 3:  First podcaster tweets their A grade → their audience discovers PodCheck
Month 6:  Media outlet references PodCheck score in article → legitimacy boost
Month 9:  Podcaster denied booking because of low score → industry talk
Month 12: "What's your PodCheck score?" becomes a common question
Month 18: Sponsors start checking scores before ad deals
Month 24: PodCheck score is standard in every podcast press kit
```

The score becomes **infrastructure** — like how Rotten Tomatoes became unavoidable for movies. You don't choose to use it. It just becomes the way things are measured.

## Key Metrics to Track Virality

- **Badge embeds**: How many sites display PodCheck badges
- **Social mentions**: Organic mentions of PodCheck scores on Twitter/Reddit
- **Score screenshots**: Image shares of report cards
- **Referral source**: What % of traffic comes from scored subjects vs. organic search
- **Self-promotion rate**: What % of A/B-graded people share their own score
- **Dispute rate**: Higher = more engagement = more trust in the process

---

## The Endgame

PodCheck doesn't need a marketing budget. It needs:

1. **Accurate scores** — the foundation of everything
2. **Beautiful, shareable visuals** — make sharing frictionless
3. **A critical mass of ~50 well-known people scored** — creates the initial conversation
4. **One viral moment** — one famous person reacting to their score

After that, the flywheel is self-sustaining. The subjects of the scores become the marketing department.

**You're not building a fact-checking site. You're building a vanity metric that happens to make the world more honest.**
