[200~# PodCheck — Technical Plan & Architecture

## 1. Product Vision & Strategy

### Mission
Build the definitive accuracy record for every public voice in podcasting. When someone makes a claim on a podcast, it gets tracked, verified, and scored — creating an accountable, searchable, evolving record of who's right and who's full of it.

### Target Users
- **Casual listeners** — "Should I trust what this guy just said?"
- **Journalists** — Vetting podcast guests before booking or citing
- **PR/Booking agents** — Checking a client's public accuracy record
- **Researchers/Academics** — Studying misinformation, media literacy
- **Podcast hosts** — Checking guest credibility before booking
- **The guests themselves** — Reputation management

### Competitive Moat
- **Data compound effect** — Every day of claims processed makes the dataset more valuable. First mover builds an insurmountable lead.
- **Network effects** — More users → more dispute/verification input → better accuracy → more trust → more users
- **Brand as arbiter** — Becoming the "credit score" for podcast credibility is a winner-take-most market

### Revenue Model (see BUSINESS.md for detail)
