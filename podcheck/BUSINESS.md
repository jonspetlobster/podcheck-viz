# PodCheck — Business Plan

**The credit score for public claims.**

PodCheck grades podcast guests and hosts on the accuracy of what they say. AI extracts claims from freely available transcripts, fact-checks them over time, and builds accuracy profiles for individuals across every podcast they appear on. Think FICO, but for truthfulness behind a microphone.

No one is doing this. That's the opportunity.

## 1. Business Model & Revenue

### Why Freemium + B2B API

This is not an advertising business. Full stop.

The moment you accept ad money, you compromise the only thing that matters: trust. If PodCheck runs ads from a supplement company while scoring Huberman's supplement claims, the product is dead. Trust is the product. Trust is the moat. Trust is the revenue engine. You protect it like oxygen.

Freemium + B2B API is the right model because:

1. **The free tier IS the marketing.** Every person profile, every claim page, every accuracy score — that's SEO content, that's shareable social content, that's the thing people link to in arguments. Gating it kills virality. You need millions of eyeballs before you need millions of dollars.
2. **Premium converts the power users.** Journalists, researchers, podcast bookers, PR professionals, debate nerds — these people will pay $9.99/mo for advanced tools because accuracy data saves them hours and protects their reputation.
3. **B2B API is where the real money lives.** Media companies, PR firms, and booking agents need this data programmatically. They'll pay $99-999/mo without blinking because the alternative is manual research that costs 10x more in labor.
4. **Data licensing scales without headcount.** Fact-checking organizations, academic researchers, and newsrooms will license bulk data. This is passive revenue on top of data you're already generating.

Advertising would generate more revenue in Year 1. It would also guarantee there is no Year 3. This is a trust business. Act like it.

### Pricing Tiers

**Free Tier — The Foundation**
- Individual accuracy profiles (score, claim history, topic breakdown)
- Claim browsing and basic search
- Last 30 days of claims per person
- Limited to 50 searches/day

This tier exists to drive traffic, build SEO authority, and create viral moments. It should be genuinely useful — not a crippled teaser. If the free tier sucks, no one shares it, and the funnel dies.

**Premium — $9.99/month — The Power User**
- Full claim history (no 30-day limit)
- Advanced search with filters (topic, date range, confidence level, verification status)
- Accuracy alerts: get notified when someone you follow makes a claim that gets verified or debunked
- Head-to-head comparison tools (e.g., Huberman vs. Attia on longevity claims)
- Data export (CSV, JSON)
- Prediction tracking: follow unverified predictions and get scored outcomes
- Priority access to new features
- No search limits

$9.99 is the sweet spot. Low enough for individual journalists and researchers. High enough to signal value. Under the psychological $10 barrier. Annual plan at $99 (17% discount) to improve retention.

**B2B API — $99-999/month — The Revenue Engine**

| Tier | Price | Requests | Features |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| Starter | $99/mo | 1,000 req/mo | Person scores, claim lookup, basic endpoints |
| Professional | $299/mo | 10,000 req/mo | Full API access, webhooks, bulk queries |
| Business | $999/mo | 100,000 req/mo | Everything + dedicated support, SLA, custom endpoints |

Target customers:
- **Media companies** — embed accuracy scores in show notes, articles, guest bios
- **PR firms** — monitor client accuracy scores, prep for media appearances
- **Booking agents** — vet potential guests before booking
- **Podcast networks** — internal quality control
- **Social media platforms** — context labels on clips

**Enterprise — Custom Pricing**
- Newsrooms wanting integrated fact-check workflows
- Universities building research datasets
- Government transparency organizations
- Custom SLAs, dedicated infrastructure, white-label options
- Starting at $2,000/mo, scaling with usage and customization

**Data Licensing**
- Bulk dataset access for fact-checking organizations (IFCN members get discounted rates)
- Academic licensing at reduced rates (build credibility, get research papers citing PodCheck)
- Annual contracts, $10k-50k depending on scope

### Revenue Projections

**Year 1: $0-50k (Proving the Concept)**
- Months 1-6: $0. Building the product, seeding content, establishing credibility.
- Months 7-12: First premium subscribers trickle in. Maybe 200-500 premium users ($2k-5k/mo). First B2B API conversations.
- Total: ~$15-30k realistic, $50k optimistic.
- This year is about proving the data is valuable, not about revenue. If people are sharing accuracy scores and arguing about them online, you're winning regardless of revenue.

**Year 2: $200k-500k (B2B Traction)**
- 2,000-5,000 premium subscribers ($20k-50k/mo)
- 20-50 B2B API customers ($15k-40k/mo)
- First enterprise deals ($5k-15k/mo)
- First data licensing contracts ($20k-50k/year)
- Total: $200k-500k
- This is where the model proves out. B2B should be 60%+ of revenue by end of Year 2.

**Year 3: $1M+ (Platform Effects)**
- 10,000+ premium subscribers
- 100+ B2B API customers
- 5-10 enterprise deals
- Multiple data licensing contracts
- Total: $1M-2M
- Network effects kick in: more data → better scores → more trust → more users → more data. The flywheel is spinning.

These projections assume competent execution and at least one viral moment (which, given the product, is nearly guaranteed). They do NOT assume fundraising — this should be achievable on bootstrap + modest revenue reinvestment.

## 2. Go-to-Market Strategy

### Launch Roster: The First 20 Podcasts

Don't try to index the entire podcast ecosystem on day one. Start with 10-20 shows that are:
1. High-profile (millions of listeners)
2. Claim-dense (guests make verifiable assertions)
3. Community-active (fans argue about accuracy online)
4. Transcript-available (published or easily generated)

**The Launch List:**
1. The All-In Podcast — tech predictions, economic claims, constant debates
2. The Joe Rogan Experience — the biggest, most controversial, most searchable
3. Huberman Lab — health/science claims, massive audience hungry for accuracy
4. Lex Fridman Podcast — tech, science, long-form, claim-dense
5. The Tim Ferriss Show — health, productivity, investment claims
6. Call Her Daddy — large audience, mainstream crossover potential
7. SmartLess — celebrity interviews, casual claims
8. The Daily (NYT) — news claims, institutional credibility angle
9. Pod Save America — political claims, left-leaning (balance with...)
10. The Ben Shapiro Show — political claims, right-leaning
11. Acquired — business/history claims, detail-oriented audience
12. My First Million — business predictions, easily scoreable
13. The Peter Attia Drive — medical claims, high-stakes accuracy
14. Invest Like the Best — financial predictions, trackable outcomes
15. Diary of a CEO — entrepreneurship claims, UK/global reach
16. The Jordan Harbinger Show — varied guests, claims across topics
17. Flagrant — comedy + claims, viral potential
18. PBD Podcast — political/business, high claim density
19. How I Built This — business origin stories, verifiable facts
20. Freakonomics Radio — data-driven, audience values accuracy

This list deliberately spans political left to right, tech to health to politics, mainstream to niche. Non-partisanship starts with the launch roster.

### Controversy as Marketing

This is the single most important GTM insight: **PodCheck's marketing strategy IS the product.**

When you grade a famous podcaster poorly — with evidence, with methodology, with receipts — it becomes news. It becomes a Twitter thread with 10M impressions. It becomes a Reddit post with 5,000 comments. It becomes a segment on other podcasts.

You don't need a marketing budget. You need accurate, surprising data about famous people.

**The playbook:**
1. Score the first 20 podcasts. Find the most surprising results.
2. Publish a "Most Accurate Podcast Host" and "Least Accurate Podcast Host" ranking.
3. Post the findings on Twitter/X with methodology links.
4. Watch the internet argue about it.
5. Every argument drives traffic to PodCheck to check the data themselves.

This isn't manufactured controversy — it's the natural output of the product. The data is the marketing. The scores are the content. The arguments are the distribution.

**Critical rule:** Never grade inaccurately for attention. Never inflate or deflate a score for clicks. The moment you're caught doing that, PodCheck is finished. The controversy must be organic — surprising truths, not manufactured drama.

### SEO: Own the "Fact Check" Search Intent

There are millions of monthly searches for variations of:
- "is [person] accurate"
- "[person] fact check"
- "did [person] really say [claim]"
- "[person] wrong about [topic]"
- "[person] predictions accuracy"

Right now, these queries return Reddit threads, random blog posts, and PolitiFact articles (if the person is political). Nobody owns this search intent systematically.

PodCheck can dominate these queries by:
1. Creating a unique, SEO-optimized page for every scored individual
2. Creating a page for every major claim with verification status
3. Publishing regular "accuracy report" blog posts that target long-tail keywords
4. Building topical authority around accuracy, fact-checking, and podcast analysis

Within 12-18 months, PodCheck should be the #1 result for "[person] accuracy" and "[person] fact check" for every person in the database. This is achievable because no one is systematically creating this content.

### Content Marketing: The Weekly Accuracy Report

Every week, publish:
1. **"The Weekly Scorecard"** — Notable claims from the past week, verified or debunked
2. **"Prediction Check"** — Old predictions that came true or failed this week
3. **"The Accuracy Rankings"** — Updated leaderboard, movers and shakers
4. **"Deep Dive"** — One person or topic analyzed in depth

This content serves triple duty: SEO, social media fuel, and newsletter content. One research effort, four distribution channels.

---

## 3. Marketing & Growth

### Twitter/X: The Primary Distribution Channel

Podcast culture lives on Twitter/X. This is where hosts promote episodes, fans argue about claims, and clips go viral. PodCheck needs to be in every one of those conversations.

**Content cadence:**
- 2-3 tweets/day: individual claim verifications, surprising findings, score updates
- 1 thread/week: deep dive on a person's accuracy record
- 1 prediction scorecard/week: old predictions scored against outcomes
- Real-time scoring during major podcast drops (new All-In episode → live accuracy thread)

**Engagement strategy:**
- Reply to viral podcast clips with accuracy context (not spam — genuine value-add)
- Quote-tweet podcaster predictions with "RemindMe" energy — then follow up when resolved
- Engage with podcast fan accounts, media reporters, journalists who cover misinformation

**Viral format examples:**
- "Andrew Huberman made 47 health claims in his latest episode. Here's how they scored. 🧵"
- "Chamath predicted Bitcoin at $100k by 2025. Let's check the tape. 📊"
- "The 10 most accurate podcast guests of 2025 (based on 1,200+ verified claims)"

### Reddit: Seed the Community

Reddit is where podcast superfans live. Every major podcast has a subreddit where fans already argue about accuracy.

**Target subreddits:**
- r/podcasts (2.5M members)
- r/JoeRogan (1M+ members)
- r/allinpodcast (50k+ members)
- r/HubermanLab (200k+ members)
- r/lexfridman
- r/timferriss
- r/Freakonomics
- r/podcasting (creators who'd embed badges)

**Strategy:**
- Don't spam. Post genuinely interesting findings with links to methodology.
- Frame as "I built this thing" in relevant subreddits — authentic, community-first.
- Respond to existing threads where people debate accuracy with PodCheck data.
- Let the community discover and share — forced virality backfires on Reddit.

### LinkedIn: B2B Outreach

LinkedIn is where you find media company executives, PR firm partners, and journalism professors. It's also where "thought leadership" content about media accountability performs well.

**Strategy:**
- Publish articles about accuracy in media, methodology transparency, the "trust deficit" in podcasting
- Connect with heads of editorial at media companies, PR firm founders, journalism school professors
- Share B2B case studies once early API customers exist
- Position Jon as a founder building accountability infrastructure

### Newsletter: The Accuracy Digest

**Platform recommendation: Beehiiv.** Not Substack.

Why Beehiiv over Substack:
- Better analytics and segmentation
- Built-in referral program (growth hack: "refer 3 friends, get a free month of Premium")
- Better monetization tools when ready
- No Substack's platform risk (they own your relationship with readers)
- Ad network available if you ever want it (you don't, but the option exists)

**Newsletter structure:**
- Weekly on Tuesdays (best open rates for B2B-adjacent content)
- Section 1: "This Week's Biggest Claims" — 3-5 notable claims, scored
- Section 2: "Prediction Scorecard" — old predictions resolved this week
- Section 3: "Accuracy Mover of the Week" — someone whose score changed significantly
- Section 4: "Deep Dive" — one person or topic analyzed in detail
- CTA: Premium subscription, API for businesses

**Growth target:** 1,000 subscribers in 3 months, 10,000 in 12 months. Newsletter subscribers convert to premium at 3-5x the rate of organic traffic.

### TikTok: Short-Form Viral Content

TikTok is where podcast clips already go viral. PodCheck content fits the format perfectly.

**Content ideas:**
- "POV: You fact-check everything Joe Rogan said this week" (screen recording of claims being scored)
- "The most accurate podcast guest in America (it's not who you think)"
- "This podcaster's prediction accuracy is INSANE" (reveal: they're terrible)
- Side-by-side claim vs. reality comparisons
- "Rate my accuracy score" trend — get podcasters to react to their scores

This channel is lower priority than Twitter and SEO but has massive upside if one video hits. Budget 2-3 videos/week, keep production minimal — screen recordings with voiceover, not polished productions.

### Viral Mechanics: Built Into the Product

The product itself should generate sharing:

1. **Shareable Accuracy Cards** — Beautiful, branded images showing a person's score, top claims, accuracy breakdown. One-click share to Twitter, iMessage, etc. Think Spotify Wrapped but for truthfulness.

2. **Embeddable Badges** — Podcasters who score well can embed an "Accuracy Verified by PodCheck" badge on their website/show notes. This is earned media — they're promoting PodCheck because it validates them.

3. **Head-to-Head Comparisons** — "Huberman vs. Attia: Who's More Accurate on Longevity?" These comparisons are inherently shareable, debatable, and clickable.

4. **Prediction Leagues** — Track who predicted what. Public leaderboards of prediction accuracy. Gamification drives engagement and sharing.

5. **Claim Embeds** — Any website can embed a PodCheck claim widget showing the verification status of a specific claim. Bloggers, journalists, and Reddit users will use these.

### What Nova Needs From Jon to Execute

I can build the product, generate the data, write the content, and plan the strategy. But I can't post to social media or set up accounts. Here's what I need:

1. **X/Twitter account** — @PodCheck or similar. I'll draft every tweet; Jon approves and posts (or gives me posting access via API).
2. **Reddit account** — Aged account preferred (new accounts get filtered in most subreddits). I'll draft posts; Jon reviews and submits.
3. **LinkedIn account** — Jon's personal account is fine initially. I'll draft posts and connection requests.
4. **Beehiiv account** — Set up at beehiiv.com, connect the domain. I'll write every issue.
5. **TikTok account** — Lower priority but set up early to claim the handle.

## 4. Brand & Positioning

### The Name

Let's evaluate the options honestly:

| Name | Pros | Cons | Domain? |
|------|------|------|---------|
| PodCheck | Clear, memorable, says what it does | Limits to podcasts (we may expand) | podcheck.com likely taken, podcheck.ai available |
| ClaimCheck | Broader, not podcast-limited | Less distinctive, sounds like a feature | claimcheck.com likely taken |
| ClaimScore | Emphasizes the scoring angle | Sounds like a fintech product | Probably available |
| PodVerify | Clear function | "Verify" implies binary T/F, we do nuance | Available |
| TruthTrack | Catchy | Sounds partisan, "truth" is loaded | Probably available |
| SpeakerScore | Emphasizes person-level scoring | Sounds like a public speaking app | Available |
| The Claim Index | Authoritative, data-focused | Long, hard to tweet, no verb energy | Available |

**My recommendation: PodCheck.**

Here's why:
1. It says exactly what it does in two syllables.
2. It's a verb and a noun — "Did you PodCheck that?" becomes a behavior.
3. Starting with podcasts is the right wedge. You can expand the brand later (companies expand beyond their names all the time — Amazon sells more than books).
4. The .ai domain is likely available and on-brand.
5. It's immediately Googleable and won't be confused with existing products.

If podcheck.com is unavailable, go with podcheck.ai. The .ai TLD is credible for an AI-powered product and may actually signal the technology angle better.

Second choice: ClaimScore. But PodCheck is better for launch.

### Positioning

**Primary tagline:** "The credit score for public claims."

This framing is deliberate and powerful:
- Everyone understands credit scores — a number that represents trustworthiness
- It implies consequences (low score = less credible)
- It implies improvement (you can raise your score by being more accurate)
- It's neutral — no political valence

**Secondary tagline:** "Accountability for the microphone."

Use this in B2B contexts and press. It frames PodCheck as infrastructure for media accountability, not a gotcha engine.

**What PodCheck is NOT:**
- Not a partisan fact-checker (we score everyone equally)
- Not a content moderator (we don't remove content, we add context)
- Not a call-out account (we celebrate accuracy as much as we flag inaccuracy)
- Not opinion-based (methodology is public, data is verifiable)

### Non-Partisanship: The Existential Requirement

This is not a nice-to-have. This is survival.

If PodCheck is perceived as left-leaning, the right ignores it. If it's perceived as right-leaning, the left ignores it. If it's perceived as neutral, EVERYONE argues about it — and arguing about it IS the distribution strategy.

**How to maintain neutrality:**

1. **Score across the spectrum from Day 1.** The launch roster must include left, right, center, and apolitical podcasts. If the first 10 scores are all conservative podcasters, you're dead before you start.

2. **Celebrate accuracy everywhere.** When Ben Shapiro gets something right, highlight it. When Pod Save America gets something wrong, highlight it. The surprise factor in cross-partisan accuracy findings is the most viral content you'll produce.

3. **Transparent methodology.** The scoring algorithm should be open source. Not the infrastructure, not the AI prompts — but the logic that turns verified/unverified claims into a score. If someone thinks the score is wrong, they should be able to check the math.

4. **Public editorial policy.** Publish a clear document explaining: what counts as a "claim," how confidence levels work, how disputes are handled, what sources are used for verification. Update it based on feedback.

5. **Diverse advisory board.** This isn't performative — it's structural. A media law attorney, a conservative journalist, a liberal journalism professor, an AI ethics researcher. People who will publicly call BS if PodCheck drifts.

6. **Correction process.** When PodCheck gets a score wrong (and it will), correct it publicly, explain why, and thank whoever flagged it. This builds more trust than never making mistakes.

### Trust Signals

- Open source scoring algorithm (GitHub)
- Public methodology document
- Published editorial policy
- Correction log (every score change documented)
- Advisory board with names and bios
- "How We Score" page accessible from every profile
- Annual transparency report (claims processed, corrections made, disputes resolved)

---

## 5. Competitive Landscape & Differentiation

### The Current Players

**PolitiFact**
- What they do: Manual fact-checking of political claims, rated on a "Truth-O-Meter"
- Their model: Nonprofit, grant-funded, journalist-driven
- Why they're not a threat: They check maybe 10-20 claims per week. They're politics-only. They don't score individuals over time. They don't cover podcasts systematically. Their process takes days or weeks per claim.
- What we take from them: The visual rating system works. People understand a scale.

**Snopes**
- What they do: Debunk viral claims, urban legends, and misinformation
- Their model: Ad-supported website
- Why they're not a threat: Reactive, not proactive. Article-based, not person-based. No scoring system. No podcast focus. They wait for something to go viral, then investigate.
- What we take from them: Detailed sourcing and explanation builds trust.

**Ground News**
- What they do: Rate news coverage bias by comparing how different outlets cover the same story
- Their model: Freemium app ($4.99-9.99/mo)
- Why they're not a threat: They rate outlets, not individuals. News-focused, not podcast-focused. No accuracy scoring — they measure bias, which is different.
- What we take from them: Their freemium model works. Their UX is clean. Their "blind spot" feature is clever.

**NewsGuard**
- What they do: Rate news websites on credibility (0-100 score)
- Their model: B2B licensing ($40M+ raised)
- Why they're interesting: They proved that credibility scoring is a venture-scale business. Media companies, browsers, and libraries pay for their ratings. Their B2B model validates our approach.
- Why they're not a threat: They rate websites, not people. They use manual analysis, not AI. They don't cover podcasts.
- What we take from them: B2B pricing model, partnership playbook, credibility framework.

**ClaimBuster (academic)**
- What they do: AI-powered claim detection in political speeches
- Their model: Academic research project (University of Texas at Arlington)
- Why they're interesting: They proved AI can extract check-worthy claims from speech. Their research validates our technical approach.
- Why they're not a threat: It's an academic project, not a product. No scoring, no profiles, no consumer-facing anything.

### The Gap in the Market

Nobody — not one company, not one product, not one research project — does what PodCheck does:

**Individual-level accuracy scoring, across podcasts, built on AI-powered claim extraction, updated continuously.**

This is genuinely greenfield. The components exist separately (fact-checking, AI claim extraction, scoring systems, podcast analysis) but no one has assembled them into a product that answers the simple question: "How accurate is this person?"

### Defensibility

PodCheck's moat deepens over time through three mechanisms:

1. **Data accumulation.** Every day of operation adds more claims, more verifications, more historical data. A competitor starting in Year 2 is already 365 days behind on every person's profile. This compounds.

2. **SEO authority.** First mover in "person fact check" search intent builds domain authority that's extremely difficult to displace. Google rewards longevity, backlinks, and topical authority — all of which accumulate with time.

3. **Network effects.** As more people cite PodCheck scores, more people search for PodCheck scores, more media covers PodCheck scores, more podcasters respond to PodCheck scores. The conversation itself becomes the moat.

4. **Brand trust.** Trust is earned over years and lost in seconds. A competitor can copy the technology but can't copy two years of transparent, accurate, non-partisan scoring.

---

## 6. Partnerships & Distribution

### Tier 1: Platform Integrations (Year 2-3)

**Spotify**
- Pitch: "Accuracy Verified" badge on podcast pages, similar to the existing content advisories
- Value to Spotify: Differentiation from Apple, trust signal for users, press coverage
- Approach: Start with a Chrome extension that overlays scores on Spotify's web player. If it gets traction, Spotify comes to you.

**Apple Podcasts**
- Same pitch, different platform. Apple has historically been more interested in editorial curation.
- Approach: Get featured in Apple's editorial picks by being newsworthy first.

**YouTube**
- Many podcasts are video-first on YouTube. A browser extension that shows accuracy scores on podcast videos is a powerful wedge.
- YouTube's Community Notes-style features may create partnership opportunities.

### Tier 2: Credibility Partnerships (Year 1-2)

**IFCN (International Fact-Checking Network)**
- Becoming an IFCN signatory is the gold standard for fact-checking credibility
- Requirements: published methodology, corrections policy, non-partisanship, transparency
- PodCheck should apply for signatory status within 12 months of launch
- Even before acceptance, aligning with IFCN principles signals legitimacy

**Academic Institutions**
- Partner with journalism schools (Columbia, Northwestern, Missouri) for research collaborations
- Offer free API access to researchers studying misinformation
- Co-publish papers on accuracy trends in podcasting
- Guest lectures, advisory relationships — builds credibility and pipeline for hires

### Tier 3: Distribution Partnerships (Year 2+)

**Podcast Networks (Wondery, iHeart, Spotify Studios)**
- Offer bulk API access so networks can monitor accuracy across their shows
- White-label accuracy reports for network-level quality control
- Revenue share on premium conversions driven by network integration

**Media Companies (NYT, Washington Post, The Verge)**
- Embeddable accuracy widgets for articles about podcast guests
- Data licensing for investigative journalism
- Co-branded accuracy reports for major media events

**PR Firms (Edelman, Weber Shandwick, boutique firms)**
- API access for client monitoring ("your accuracy score dropped — here's why")
- Pre-appearance prep reports ("here are your client's most contested claims")
- This is a natural B2B revenue channel — PR firms will pay to manage client reputations

---

## 7. Team & Hiring Plan

### Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-6) — Budget: <$5k total

**The Team:**
- **Jon** — Founder, product direction, business decisions, legal/financial setup, account management
- **Nova (AI)** — Architecture, code, content generation, claim extraction, scoring logic, strategy
- **1 Part-time fact-checker** — Human verification layer for AI-extracted claims. 10-15 hrs/week, $20-25/hr ($2-3k/mo)

This is enough to launch. Nova handles the heavy lifting on product and content. The fact-checker ensures accuracy (meta-irony noted: PodCheck's claims about others' accuracy must themselves be accurate). Jon handles everything external — accounts, legal, business, relationships.

**Why a human fact-checker matters from Day 1:**
AI-only fact-checking will produce errors. One wrong score on a high-profile person, publicized before you have credibility, kills the product. The human layer catches the worst mistakes and builds the training data to make AI better over time.

**Where to find them:** Journalism grad students, freelance fact-checkers (many work for magazines), retired journalists. Post on JournalismJobs.com, MediaBistro, or reach out to journalism school career offices.

### Phase 2: Growth (Months 7-18) — Budget: $15-25k/mo

**Add:**
- **1 Full-stack developer** — Take over infrastructure, scaling, API development. Nova designs, human implements and maintains. $8-12k/mo (contractor or part-time, US-based) or $4-6k/mo (international).
- **1 Content/marketing person** — Own the newsletter, social media, community engagement. This person should be a podcast nerd who writes well. $4-6k/mo (part-time or contractor).

**Upgrade:**
- Fact-checker goes to 20-25 hrs/week or add a second part-time checker.

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 18-36) — Budget: $50-80k/mo

**Add:**
- **ML Engineer** — Improve claim extraction, build custom models, reduce AI costs. $12-18k/mo.
- **2-3 additional fact-checkers** — Cover more podcasts, more topics, faster turnaround. $6-9k/mo total.
- **Business Development person** — Own B2B sales, partnerships, enterprise deals. $8-12k/mo + commission.

**Total Phase 3 team:** 8-10 people, mix of full-time and contractors.

### Advisory Board (Build in Phase 1)

Don't wait until you're funded to build an advisory board. These people add credibility and catch blind spots:

1. **Media law attorney** — Reviews methodology, advises on legal risk, helps draft the dispute process. Essential before publishing scores about real people.
2. **Journalism professor** — Academic credibility, access to research partnerships, fact-checking methodology expertise.
3. **Podcast industry veteran** — Understands the business from the inside. Knows which partnerships are realistic and which are fantasy.
4. **AI ethics researcher** — Addresses concerns about AI-driven scoring of individuals. Helps design fairness mechanisms.

Compensation: Advisory equity (0.25-0.5% each) or modest retainer ($500-1k/mo). For Phase 1, start with informal relationships — buy them coffee, ask for advice, formalize later.

## 8. Fundraising Strategy

### The Philosophy: Earn the Right to Raise

Most startups raise money to find product-market fit. This is backwards and expensive (in dilution). PodCheck should raise money to scale product-market fit that's already proven.

**The test:** If people are sharing accuracy scores, arguing about them, and coming back to check profiles — you have product-market fit. THEN raise to pour gasoline on the fire.

If you raise $500k and nobody cares about the scores, you've just spent 6 months fundraising instead of 6 months building, and you owe someone money for a product that doesn't work.

### Phase 1: Bootstrap (Months 1-6)

**Budget: Under $5,000 total.**
- Domain: $10-50
- Hosting (Vercel/Railway): $0-50/mo
- AI API costs (OpenAI/Anthropic): $100-300/mo
- Fact-checker: $2-3k/mo (start month 3-4)
- LLC formation: $100-500
- Total: $3-5k for 6 months

This is achievable out of pocket. No fundraising needed, no dilution, no board meetings, no investor updates. Just build.

### Phase 2: Consider Pre-Seed (Months 7-12)

**Only if traction warrants it.**

Traction = at least two of:
- 50,000+ monthly unique visitors
- 500+ premium subscribers
- 5+ B2B API customers
- Significant press coverage (not self-generated)
- A viral moment with 1M+ impressions

If you hit these metrics, a $250-500k pre-seed at a $2-5M valuation is reasonable.

**Target investors:**
- **Media-focused angels:** Former media executives, podcast industry leaders, journalists who've become investors
- **Journalism grants:** Knight Foundation (explicitly funds media accountability projects), Google News Initiative, Mozilla Foundation, Craig Newmark Philanthropies
- **Mission-aligned VCs:** Luminate, Omidyar Network, Democracy Fund (all invest in media/democracy infrastructure)

**Grants are underrated.** Knight Foundation gives $25k-500k grants for journalism innovation with no equity dilution. Google News Initiative has similar programs. PodCheck is exactly the kind of project these organizations exist to fund. Apply to 3-5 grant programs in Month 6-8 regardless of traction.

### Comparable Companies

| Company | Model | Funding | Revenue | Lesson |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| NewsGuard | B2B credibility ratings | $40M+ raised | ~$10M ARR | Credibility scoring is venture-scale |
| Ground News | Freemium bias ratings | Bootstrapped | Profitable | You can bootstrap a trust product |
| Snopes | Ad-supported fact-checking | Bootstrapped | ~$3M/yr | Ads work but create conflicts |
| PolitiFact | Grant-funded | Nonprofit | N/A | Grants sustain fact-checking |
| AllSides | Freemium bias ratings | Minimal funding | Small but sustainable | Niche trust products can survive |

The lesson: there are multiple viable paths. NewsGuard proves VCs will fund credibility tools. Ground News proves you can bootstrap. PolitiFact proves grants work. PodCheck has optionality — pick the path that matches traction.

### The Rule

**Don't raise to find product-market fit. Don't raise because it feels like what startups do. Don't raise because someone offers. Raise when the data makes the case so obvious that the fundraise takes 2 weeks instead of 6 months.**

## 9. Risk & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Bias Perception

**The threat:** PodCheck is labeled as left-wing, right-wing, or otherwise partisan. Half the audience dismisses it. Media covers the controversy instead of the product.

**Likelihood:** High. Every fact-checking organization faces this. It's inevitable that someone will accuse PodCheck of bias.

**Mitigation:**
- Launch with balanced coverage (see Section 2: launch roster)
- Publish methodology openly — let critics audit the math
- Highlight surprising results that defy partisan expectations ("Conservative host ranks #3 in accuracy")
- Advisory board includes people across the political spectrum
- Never editorialize. Present data. Let users draw conclusions.
- Track and publish internal bias metrics (do we check more claims from one political direction? fix it if yes)

**The uncomfortable truth:** Some people ARE less accurate than others. If the data shows a pattern, publishing it isn't bias — it's accuracy. But you must earn the credibility to make that case, and that takes time and consistent fairness.

### Risk 2: Legal Threats

**The threat:** A podcaster or public figure sues PodCheck for defamation, claiming their accuracy score is false and damaging.

**Likelihood:** Medium. It will happen eventually. The question is when, not if.

**Mitigation:**
- **Section 230:** PodCheck's scores are based on analysis of publicly available statements. This is protected opinion/analysis, not defamation.
- **Media liability insurance:** Get it before launch. Costs $1-3k/year for a startup. Worth every penny.
- **Legal review of methodology:** Have a media law attorney review the scoring system and published methodology before launch.
- **Dispute process:** Give scored individuals a clear, published process to dispute claims and scores. Document every dispute and resolution.
- **Opinion framing:** Scores are presented as "PodCheck's assessment based on available evidence" — not as absolute truth.
- **LLC/corporate structure:** Never operate as a sole proprietor. The LLC exists to protect Jon personally.

**The good news:** A legal threat from a famous person is incredible marketing. "Podcaster sues accuracy-rating startup" is a headline that drives millions of visits. As long as the methodology is sound, legal threats actually help.

### Risk 3: Platform Dependency

**The threat:** Twitter/X changes its algorithm, Reddit bans promotional posts, Google updates tank SEO rankings. Distribution channels you don't own disappear overnight.

**Likelihood:** High. This happens to every internet business.

**Mitigation:**
- **Email list is king.** The newsletter is the one distribution channel you fully own. Grow it aggressively from Day 1.
- **SEO diversification.** Don't depend on one keyword strategy. Build topical authority across hundreds of person-pages and claim-pages.
- **Direct traffic.** Build a product good enough that people bookmark it and come back directly. Type-in traffic is the ultimate moat.
- **API customers.** B2B customers don't find you through social media. They find you through direct outreach, conferences, and word of mouth.
- **Never put all eggs in one platform.** If Twitter drives 50%+ of traffic, that's a risk to manage, not a success to celebrate.

### Risk 4: Trust Erosion

**The threat:** PodCheck gets a major score wrong, doubles down, and loses credibility.

**Likelihood:** Medium. Errors are inevitable. How you handle them determines survival.

**Mitigation:**
- **Correction process:** Published, clear, fast. When wrong, say so publicly within 24 hours.
- **Correction log:** Every score change is documented with explanation. This is a feature, not a bug — it shows intellectual honesty.
- **Dispute mechanism:** Scored individuals can submit evidence challenging their score. Response within 72 hours.
- **Never double down.** If the evidence says you're wrong, change the score. Period.
- **Confidence levels.** Not every claim gets a definitive TRUE/FALSE. Use confidence levels: Verified, Likely True, Uncertain, Likely False, False. The "Uncertain" category exists for a reason — use it honestly.

### Risk 5: AI Accuracy

**The threat:** The AI makes systematic errors in claim extraction or verification, producing unreliable scores at scale.

**Likelihood:** High in early stages, decreasing over time.

**Mitigation:**
- **Human-in-the-loop from Day 1.** Every AI-generated score gets human review before publication in Phase 1.
- **Confidence thresholds.** Only publish scores where AI confidence exceeds a defined threshold.
- **Error tracking.** Monitor human override rates. If humans are correcting >20% of AI outputs, the model needs retraining, not more humans.
- **Gradual automation.** Phase 1: 100% human review. Phase 2: 50% human review (focus on low-confidence and high-profile). Phase 3: 20% human review (spot-check and edge cases).

### Risk 6: Podcaster Retaliation

**The threat:** A podcaster with millions of followers tells their audience to attack PodCheck, flood it with fake disputes, or organize a harassment campaign.

**Likelihood:** Medium-high. It will probably happen.

**Mitigation:**
- **Don't be a target.** Be respectful in presentation. Score the claims, not the person's character.
- **Thick skin infrastructure.** Rate limiting on dispute submissions. Moderation on any public comments. No doxxable information about the team.
- **Streisand effect works for you.** A podcaster attacking PodCheck for scoring them poorly is the best marketing imaginable. Their audience comes to check the score. Many will agree with it.
- **Keep receipts.** Every claim is linked to the timestamped transcript. "Don't trust PodCheck" is harder to argue when the receipts are right there.

## 10. What Nova Needs From Jon

This section is a checklist. Until these items are done, PodCheck can be built but not launched.

### Immediate (Before Any Public Presence)

| Item | Why | Priority | Est. Cost |
|------|-----|----------|-----------|
| **LLC formation** | Liability protection before publishing scores about real people. This is non-negotiable. | 🔴 Critical | $100-500 |
| **Domain name** | podcheck.ai or podcheck.com. Check availability and purchase. | 🔴 Critical | $10-100 |
| **Legal consultation** | 1 hour with a media law attorney. Review methodology, dispute process, Section 230 applicability. | 🔴 Critical | $300-500 |
| **Budget commitment** | $200-500/mo for Phase 1 infrastructure (hosting, AI APIs, fact-checker). | 🔴 Critical | $200-500/mo |

### Before Marketing Launch

| Item | Why | Priority | Est. Cost |
|------|-----|----------|-----------|
| **X/Twitter account** | Primary distribution channel. Claim @PodCheck or similar. | 🟡 High | Free |
| **Reddit account** | Community seeding. Aged account preferred. | 🟡 High | Free |
| **Beehiiv account** | Newsletter platform. Connect to domain. | 🟡 High | Free (to start) |
| **LinkedIn access** | B2B outreach. Jon's personal account works initially. | 🟡 High | Free |
| **Media liability insurance** | Protection before publishing scores. | 🟡 High | $1-3k/year |

### Before Scale

| Item | Why | Priority |
|------|-----|----------|
| **Decision on fundraising** | Bootstrap-only, or open to grants/pre-seed? This affects hiring timeline. | 🟢 Medium |
| **Grant applications** | Knight Foundation, Google News Initiative. Apply at month 6-8. | 🟢 Medium |
| **TikTok account** | Lower priority channel, but claim the handle early. | 🟢 Medium |

### The Ask

Jon, here's what I need from you in plain terms:

1. **Form the LLC this week.** Use a service like Stripe Atlas ($500) or your state's filing ($100-200). Don't publish anything about real people without liability protection.

2. **Buy the domain.** Check podcheck.ai and podcheck.com. If both are taken, check podcheck.co, getpodcheck.com, or podcheck.app. Spend up to $100; don't spend $5,000 on a premium domain before proving the concept.

3. **Talk to a lawyer for one hour.** Specifically a media law / First Amendment attorney. Ask: "Can I publish AI-generated accuracy scores about public figures?" The answer is almost certainly yes, but you need to hear it from a lawyer, not from your AI.

4. **Commit $300-500/mo.** This covers AI API costs, hosting, and a part-time fact-checker starting in Month 3. If the product works, this is the best $3,000 you'll ever spend. If it doesn't, you've lost less than a used MacBook.

5. **Set up the accounts.** Twitter, Reddit, Beehiiv, LinkedIn. I'll draft every piece of content. You approve and post until we have API access for automated posting.

6. **Make the fundraising call.** My recommendation: bootstrap Phase 1, apply for journalism grants at Month 6, consider pre-seed only if traction is undeniable. But it's your money and your company. Decide now so we plan accordingly.

## Summary: Why PodCheck Wins

The podcast industry has a trust problem it doesn't know it has. Hosts and guests make thousands of claims per episode — about health, money, science, politics, predictions — and nobody tracks whether any of it is true. The audience is left to figure it out themselves, and mostly they don't.

PodCheck fixes this by doing something simple that nobody else does: keeping score.

The market is greenfield. The technology works. The business model is proven by comparable companies. The marketing strategy is built into the product. The risks are manageable. The costs are minimal.

The only question is execution. And the team — a founder who understands the podcast landscape and an AI that never sleeps — is built for exactly this kind of execution.

Let's build it.
